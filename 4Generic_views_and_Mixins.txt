The generic views provided by REST framework allow you to quickly build API views that map closely to your database models.

If the generic views don't suit the needs of your API, you can drop down to using the regular APIView class, or reuse the mixins and base classes used by the generic views to compose your own set of reusable generic views.

CreateModelMixin, RetrieveModelMixin, UpdateModelMixin, DestroyModelMixin, ListModelMixin

The view classes can be imported from rest_framework.generics.

You can create, update, retrieve and delete the data from the output.(In browser)
